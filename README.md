# PyChat

## A minimalistic encrypted peer-to-peer chat software.

This software was a project for my 12th grade computer programming course. I'm posting it on GitHub mostly for myself, but also in order to help anyone who would like to learn from it. The code is far from being perfect, but it works, and I try to do my best to always improve it.

It uses RSA and AES256 in order to provide end-to-end encryption.

Please not that it was only tested on Python 3.
